# Simple Neural Network

> A [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), consisting of a single neuron that uses back propagation to learn [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate)

## Dependencies

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) (optional. used just for convenience)

## Usage

> for Jupyter Notebook, run `Simple Neural Network.ipynb` with [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) viewer

> for using in your project, 
`include this in your project, import and use it as follows`

``` nn = SimpleNeuralNetwork(dimensions)
    nn.train(train_x, train_y, iterations)
    test_y = nn.predict(test_x)
```
